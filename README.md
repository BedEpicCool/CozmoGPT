# CozmoGPT
CozmoGPT is a project that aims to provide Cozmo with some basic AI functionality while maintaining his original programming and functions. 


# Prerequisites 
1. ADB (https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) or iTunes (https://www.apple.com/itunes/).
3. Python 3.9 from https://www.python.org/downloads/
4. An extracted Vosk model from https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
5. Packages/Dependencies: PyTorch, Transformers, PyAudio, Vosk, Ascyncio, Cozmo, and Keyboard. To get these dependenccies, run "pip install PyTorch Transformers PyAudio Vosk Ascyncio Cozmo Keyboard"

# Setup
1. Add the path to where you downloaded your vosk model in main.py (specific instructions located in the aforementioned file).
2. Open CMD or PS from the file dirrectory with main.py in it. Alterantively, use the "cd" command to direct CMD or PS to the correct file directory.
3. Run the following command: "py -3.9 main.py"

# Disclaimer
At the current moment, CozmoGPT is quite new and is quite buggy, so be prepared for bugs. Also, Cozmo does not move or perform his non-sdk normal actions yet, however, he does talk to you, and I am working on implementing more features. At the current moment, I have a rudimentary understanding of python, so please feel free to fork this repository and expand upon this project. I can't wait to see what y'all come up with!
